        <p class="text-muted">SeekAndWatch is free and open source. Here's how you can help it thrive.</p>

        <h3>How this project started</h3>
        <p class="support-body">SeekAndWatch started as a simple media scanner to recommend movies and TV shows for my wife. It's since taken on a life of its own (Smart Discovery, Plex Collections, Kometa builder, Radarr/Sonarr integration, and more), and I'm glad it's useful to others too. Thanks for being part of it.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card setting-card border-green" style="margin-bottom: 24px;">
        <h3>Best way to support: spread the word</h3>
        <p class="support-body mb-15">The most valuable support is telling others about SeekAndWatch when it fits.</p>
        <ul class="support-list">
            <li>Recommend us on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" style="color: var(--accent-color); text-decoration: underline;">Reddit</a> when someone asks for tools like ours (smart discovery, Plex collections, Radarr/Sonarr helpers, etc.).</li>
            <li>Mention us to friends or in communities when people are looking for "something to recommend movies and TV" or "a way to manage Plex collections."</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="support-body">Word of mouth and honest recommendations mean more than anything else.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card setting-card" style="margin-bottom: 24px;">
        <h3>If you have spare money</h3>
        <p class="support-body mb-15">I've put a lot of time into SeekAndWatch and had a blast building it. If you're able to chip in a coffee or two, that would mean a lot, but no pressure at all.</p>
        <p class="support-body mb-15">You can support with a one-time coffee here:</p>
